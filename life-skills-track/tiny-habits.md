# Tiny Habits :rocket:

In this drill, I'll be diving into the world of habits and how they can be a gamechanger. I'll be looking at some videos and try to answer the fundamental questions around this topic.

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg :mountain:

#### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for me?

Behaviour= MAT-- Motivation, Ability and Trigger

- Consistency in performing small actions is more effective than occasional big changes in creating lasting habits.
- By starting with small, easily achievable habits, individuals can build momentum and increase the likelihood of long-term success.
- Celebrating small victories along the way can help reinforce positive behaviors and motivate continued progress.
- The concept of “tiny is mighty” emphasizes the impact of small actions in achieving - significant outcomes over time.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message :fire:

#### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

MAP is Motivation,Ability and Prompt.
``

    - Shrink habits to tiny versions to require minimal motivation.

    - Use action prompts to trigger new behaviors after completing a task.

    - Celebrate small wins to boost motivation and confidence.

``

####  Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Celebrating small wins generates a sense of accomplishment and motivates further habit development. Success momentum is built through frequent celebrations, leading to sustained behavior change. 

## 3. 1% Better Every Day Video
#### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
Changing habits is not just about behavior change but identity change. :fire: :fire:

- Our behaviors are reflections of who we believe ourselves to be. "I'm not a morning person" so you hit snooze.
"- I'm bad at saving money" so you keep splurging.
- If you want your habits to stick, you need to change your identity. See yourself as someone who prioritizes sleep (morning person) or is financially responsible.
- Each positive action reinforces this new identity. Every workout makes you more of an athlete, every meditation session strengthens your identity as someone who prioritizes well-being.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits :wave:

#### What is the book's perspective about Identity?

Identity change is the north start of habit change. It relates to intrinsic motivation. To really extract the instrinsic motivation of doing something and really enjoy it, we need to adjust what we think our identity is.

#### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

if you want to establish a new habit, consider attaching it to an existing routine or activity to increase its ease of execution, the concept is called Habit Stacking.

#### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

- Make it less convinient. (for example: take it out of sight)
- Be specific about your intention on doing the habit. 
- Set clear boundaries.
- change your mindset about the habit.
## Reflections :mirror:

#### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

##### --steps--
- Make study table clean and tidy with the laptop and coffee ready.
- Set timer prompts for coding periods.
- Set clear time periods for practise time stack it with other exisiting habit like after dinner,breakfast etc.
- After coding period do an enjoyable task like listening to music or talk to loved ones.

#### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
- Watch less youtube reels
- Take the phone out of sight
- Turn off notifications
- Determine beforehand, why to use the phone?
