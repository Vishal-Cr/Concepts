You can find the module [here](https://github.com/mountblue/life-skills-track/blob/main/good-practices-for-software-development.md).


## What were the points that were new to me?
- Overcommunicate aspects, Although this applies to some scenarios, not all. I always thought to bother the client or supervisor as less as possible. But now it's clear that proper completion of the project is the main priority and proper communication is a necessity for doing so.


- Communication also includes gathering as much data as possible. Taking efficient notes can be a beneficial game.


## What areas can I improve on?
- Reserving my attention is channeling it to more productive tasks.
- Communication questions I ask, the questions I ask can be improved in both comprehensiveness and ease of reading.
- Taking notes, I need to find better ways to take quick and efficient notes.
- Communicating with colleagues when I need help.
