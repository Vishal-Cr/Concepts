Active listening is a crucial skill for effective communication and effective communication is one of the most important pillar for success in modern times.

1. **Pay Attention**: Give the speaker your undivided attention. Avoid distractions, maintain eye contact, and be present in the moment.

2. **Show That You're Listening**: Use body language and gestures to convey your engagement. Nodding, smiling, and maintaining an open posture can help.

3. **Provide Feedback**: Reflect on what has been said by paraphrasing. For example, "What I'm hearing is..." or "It sounds like you are saying..." This shows that you are processing the information.

4. **Defer Judgment**: Allow the speaker to finish their point before you offer your thoughts. Avoid interrupting or forming counterarguments while they are speaking.

5. **Respond Appropriately**: Be candid, open, and honest in your responses. Assert your opinions respectfully and empathetically.
